    Our Plant Disease Recognition System uses cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify various plant diseases from images. It helps farmers, gardeners, and agricultural experts to quickly diagnose plant health issues and take appropriate action.

    ### How it Works:
    - **Upload an Image:** The user uploads an image of the plant leaf.
    - **Processing:** The system analyzes the image using a trained machine learning model.
    - **Result:** The disease is identified, and solutions are provided to mitigate the damage.

    ### Technologies Used:
    - **Streamlit:** For creating a user-friendly web application.
    - **TensorFlow:** For building and deploying the machine learning model.
    - **OpenCV and PIL:** For image processing.
